# Python-Face-Detection
Face Detection by using opencv module and numpy Library of Python.

Python-Face-Detection is a project leveraging Python and OpenCV to identify and locate human faces in images or video streams. It uses pre-trained Haar cascades or deep learning models like DNN for real-time detection. It is ideal for applications in surveillance, authentication, or enhancing user interactions with AI-driven interfaces.
